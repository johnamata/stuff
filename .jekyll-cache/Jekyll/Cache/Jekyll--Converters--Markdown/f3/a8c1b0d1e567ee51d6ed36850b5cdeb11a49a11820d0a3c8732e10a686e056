I"Ö<p>I dont know the reason for making this blog. Was it because itâ€™s 2 AM and I dont know what else to do? Is it because I got a dopamine hit from reading an article whose title says <a href="https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing">Donâ€™t End The Week With Nothing</a>? Is it because I didnt feel proud of the past week and want to start this new week with a bang? Whichever the case, letâ€™s see where this blog goes.</p>
