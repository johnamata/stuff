Today is a productive day. 

Made some good gains today with CTSI. Made ~<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-do-you-calculate-percentage-gain-or-loss-investment/">50% profit</a> on a 2 day trade. Entered at BTC 0.000005 around march 22 and exited at around BTC 0.000008 this noon. Just got em out and poured it all to BAT, entering at $1.08. Risky but fuck it, benefits of being (I wish) early adopters. 

Photo below is a pic of me contemplating about trading my shit buy bitcoin/usdt again and swing some. But I declined as I dont want to be to monitor too many crap on my portfolio. Not really sure if I should keep trading crypto, but bull market is here for the meantime and I'm feeling good like it's 2016-2017 again. Quite a shame i didnt mine some more bitcoin in 2013. BUt then again, my friend (Mico Baronia, a fellow CS student) who introduced me to bitcoin in 2013, quit his mining early and later sold out all his bitcoin when 1 bitcoin jumped to PHP 20k (that's $400 in today's PHP-USD exchange) and never bought any shit again.

Back then we just didnt pay any attention to bitcoin. To us teens, it was just some random free internet money. Some scam you do to squeeze some more money for those dates and to buy whatever crap you need in life, which in my case at the time was nothing. I wasnt a big spender then just like I am now.

I think it's not too late to get into crypto. I only started in crypto late in 2016, and taking it very seriously in 2017 putting all my money there after reading some hype gathering in hacker news posts. Back then hacker news was still very much against it (I think they still do now) and view it as a scam. Nonetheless I could see that a bunch of developers getting interested in it and whenever developers are getting interested in a space, you can bet there's money going there. That coupled with the fact that hacker news community is 99% wrong about everything, kek, gave me hope. 

I even thought about learning blockchain development and enrolled in a couple udemy courses, one of which was stephen grider's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/">Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide</a>.

I later learned that solidity dApp crap is pretty basic, and that the bulk of a blockchain dev's skills should be about building for consensus (at least at the time, i dont know about it now), and to git gud at C++ (at leas at the time.

I didnt follow that career after I graduated in 2018. I took a break from pretty much anything to travel for a year and think about what i want next in life. Anyways, what happened next is a long story that probably warrants to be published in my private blogs or in my more "polished" blogs.

Anyhow, besides today's sweet trade, I started learning some German and french at duolingo. 

I did about 50 practice sessions and 10 lesson sesssions today at duolingo. You earn XP or experience for every session you complete (of which 1 session has 11-16 problems to solve) and that got me to the top of the leaderboard for this week. If i keep myself in the top position for this week's leaderboard, I'll get promoted to the next league (I'm currently in the bronze league). It's some virtual award, which basically means nothing. But gamification does work wonders on motivation. Still got 4 more days to defend my position, do a bunch of lessons and practice sessions every day so the rest of these peeps arent near me in the #1 spot. Let's see where we stand on Monday, if I get promoted from bronze to silver league.

I did a lot to put myself ahead of everyone as I started the week a bit late to compete well for the bronze league, so I blitz through and did 800+ XP worth of problems in a day (768 XP of which went to bronze league). Feel free to connect with me at duolingo, my username there is johnamata. Same as my github username. You can also <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/johnamata">view my profile here</a>.

To further motivate myself, I used toggl to track how long I spent studying german with duolingo and memrise, and it told me that I spent <strong>2 hours and a half</strong> studying it today. Pretty nice. I was already proud of myself after the first hour, and rewarded myself with the following meal:

Yeah, it's a pretty bland meal especially when compared to nearby asian cuisine but that's a nice filipino snack right there.

Doggo and i also walked around the village, got some good amount of sunlight vitamin D at 4pm. That put some heat into my veins so afterwards I did 100 pushups, 200 pullups, and 50 ab wheels. I'll just do some resistance bands, barbell, and dumbbell work tomorrow. My weights at home are light for me though. Man, I miss the gym. Damn corona-chan.

I just cant wait til COVID-69 ends. Though what's next after it? A recession? Asteroid armageddon? Today I just read a hacker news comment on a thread about the US navy possibly being swarmed by alien drones. So... are intergalactic wars next? MichaelMoser123 in the hacker news thread agrees

You got to admit, that's a cool way to end a chapter for humanity, compared to the one where we nuke each other to oblivion and decay as nuke winter settles. More boring one is that overpopulation or climate change apocalypse scenario, though I'm pretty sure a climate change apocalypse is extremely unlikely, despite what the oftentimes screaming liberal-leaning activists and the media says. Humans adapt pretty quick and we already have (and getting better) carbon removal tech. I'm curious about how humans will cope with an alien civilization. 

I'm pretty sure we'll win especially by attrition unless they pull out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star">death star</a>

I'd honestly put my money on a skynet-like AI destroying the human civilization than some aliens. UNless the aliens are the borg! Man, that reminded me to watch star trek. All of it is on netflix I think. It's 23:17 and a star trek viewing whilst eating this well cooked pancit looks like a nice way to end the day. So that wraps up this writing exercise
