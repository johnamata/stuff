summary: lazy day but at least we do leetcode

Yeah so I'm basically swallowing the leetcode pill for now, and decided to just spend some time everyday doing some easy problems at leetcode, just so that I can prep for coding interviews that use such metrics (textbook algorithm problem solving) to filter candidates.

I dont know which dude started it, some say it's Google, but right now leetcode centric interviews are starting to dominate the industry. And everytime I go to even forums and facebook groups in my country, most peeps are placing weird amount of importance on algorithms. I still dont understand why, you can pretty much just google algorithms nowadays. All you need is just some basic understanding of it and know how to derive time and space complexity. But people still are in that leetcode grind thing

So right now, I'm reviewing some data structures and algorithms in Java and starting with leetcode easies, specifically the ones with an array tag at leetcode. Such a bummer but you know what they say, the moment you become good at something, you start enjoying that something - because people love winning.

Anyhow, I did something productive today, which was I ate out. Walked to some burger king branch then ordered food. I view eating out as productive time.

I definitely place eating burgers over mindless leetcoding

Unfortunately the branch wasnt letting people dine there and only does take out orders. It's because of coronachan. The new african strain put fear bck into the hearts of the people (rightly so), thanks mostly to the usual propagandic fearmongering by the media. Well, at least the media isnt 1984 here in the Philippines compared to say, platforms like twitter and outlets like CNN and washington post in the US/west.

That thought made me enjoy my whopper jr and a bag of onion rings at home
