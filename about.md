For now I'm a hobbyist programmer. A 2018 CS grad that got lucky in crypto in 2016 and especially in 2017, then later in business. After reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">"The 4 Hour-Workweek"</a> I realised that I have enough to retire, maybe travel and do whatever "lost people" do in their twenties. Just like my friends and other lazy millennials nowadays, whenever I see older people working in the office I always thought <i>"why are they still here? why havent they started a business and gotten rich?"</i> But after getting to know people and reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hole-Focus-Intelligent-Powerful/dp/0857085611">Black Hole Focus</a>, I realised that all you need in life is just a job you are passionate at, living a simple life and doing things that challenge you. It's always about the journey, enjoying the grind and the simple things. The rest are just noise.
